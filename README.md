# DreamsOnWheels - dowStyle repo

## Milestone4 - CodeInstitute

dowStyle repo has been used as an experimentation platform when developing the DOW website static elements and UI.

This does not representation the complete and final look of the site.

Separating the development process between UI and building the functionality and UX of the website helped at beginning to focus my workflow.
